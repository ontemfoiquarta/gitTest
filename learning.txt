COMMAND LINE INTERFACE - 

1 - EDITING THE LINE:

	Command Lines include several features to make it easy to repeat previous commands.
	One of the most useful ways to edit the line is to "up arrow", which simply retrieves 
	the previous command.
	
	Other common ways to edit the line use the control key, generally paired with
	"A", "E" or "U". [CTRl A] takes us to the beggining of the line, [CTRL E] takes us 
	to the end of the line and [CTRL U] clears to the beggining of the line and
	lets us start over.

1.1 - CLEANING UP:

	When using the command line sometimes it's convenient to be able to clean up by clearing
	the screen, we can by using [Clear] ou [CRTL L]

	Similarly, when we are done the a terminal window and are ready to exit we can use the
	[Exit] command or use the shortcut [CTRL D]


GIT BASICS

2 - GIT CHEATSHEET

Commands related to a remote repository:

	git clone git@github.com:USER-NAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git
	git push or git push origin main (Both accomplish the same goal in this context)


Commands related to the workflow:

	git add .
	git commit -m "A message describing what you have done to make this snapshot different"


Commands related to checking status or log history

	git status
	git log



The basic Git syntax is program | action | destination.

For example,

	git add . is read as git | add | ., where the period represents everything in the current directory;
	git commit -m "message" is read as git | commit -m | "message"; and
	git status is read as git | status | (no destination).
