COMMAND LINE INTERFACE - 

1 - EDITING THE LINE:

	Command Lines include several features to make it easy to repeat previous commands.
	One of the most useful ways to edit the line is to "up arrow", which simply retrieves 
	the previous command.
	
	Other common ways to edit the line use the control key, generally paired with
	"A", "E" or "U". [CTRl A] takes us to the beggining of the line, [CTRL E] takes us 
	to the end of the line and [CTRL U] clears to the beggining of the line and
	lets us start over.

1.1 - CLEANING UP:

	When using the command line sometimes it's convenient to be able to clean up by clearing
	the screen, we can by using [Clear] ou [CRTL L]

	Similarly, when we are done the a terminal window and are ready to exit we can use the
	[Exit] command or use the shortcut [CTRL D]
